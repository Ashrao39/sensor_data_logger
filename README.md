# Sensor Data Logger (Simulation)

#This Python project simulates reading temperature and humidity from sensors. It prints readings to the console and logs them into a CSV file.

## Files
- `sensor_logger.py`: Prints live simulated sensor readings.
- `log_to_csv.py`: Logs sensor data into `sensor_data_log.csv`.

## How to Run
```bash
python sensor_logger.py
python logtocsv.py
